There are 2 features in this simple program.  

One is to add a scanner to ask users for inputs. Users are asked to input 6 integers, and they are used to form an array.  
Another feature is sorting the array with java.util.Arrays by simply calling Array.sort() in a method.  

Lastly, the program prints out the array before sorting and after sorting ensure both features work.
